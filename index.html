  <h1>Sentiment Analysis of Billboard Top 100 1965 - 2015</h1>

  </h6>
  <p>
    Each year, Billboard releases the top 100 songs of that year. For this visualization,
    we have taken those historical rankings since 1965 and computed sentiment scores for
    each song's lyrics using python's TextBlob which provides a sentiment value between
    -1 (very negative) and +1 (very positive). The main view shows the average sentiment
    score per year across all 100 of that year's songs. The particular year's highest
    and lowest scores are also shown with dots. By clicking on a specific point
    in the graph, the view to its right will be populated with sentiment score information
    and other data about each of the 100 songs from that year. Using the radio toggle buttons
    above the main view, the view will switch to computing average sentiment score by rank instead
    of by year. Maximum and minimum dots are updated accordingly. Clicking a specific point will
    also populate the right hand view, this time showing all songs with a particular rank.
    You can also view a heatmap of all songs in the dataest. Below this, you can search for a
    specific artist to see a similar view for all of their songs that made Billboard's rankings. Enjoy.
